# twine-xtd
Extended version of the Twine granular script for Norns, with 3 sample slots.
Can't tell yet if it the 3rd slot is a parasitic outgrowth of the twins or a twon in its own right, in which case the script should be renamed Thrine :)

Added features:

- Randomize seek per sample slot (with timer)
- Automate density and size per sample slot via LFO
- 3 sample slots

-Considerations-

- To randomize sample slot 3, long-press K1
- E3 also moves the seek position of sample slot 3 in the opposite direction of the other slots.
